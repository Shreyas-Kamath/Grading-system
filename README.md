# Grading-system
somewhat stable grading system

This program will read from a file containing records of students with Physics, Chemistry, Maths marks in CSV format and produce a results file and a folder containing individual reports.
sample csv file is attached.
No error handling because I cant be bothered

want to make your own csv?
Format is:
Name,Int,Int,Int

marks should be less than max value of uint8_t (0<=256)
